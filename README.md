- **CLAUDE.md**: Detailed instructions for AI assistants working with the codebase

## Rails-Inspired Architecture

Tetrastack borrows successful patterns from Ruby on Rails:

### Convention Over Configuration

- **Models Layer** (`src/models/`): Database operations and business logic
- **Actions Layer** (`src/actions/`): Server actions for mutations (prefer over API routes)
- **Many-First Pattern**: All CRUD operations work with arrays by default
- **Generic Admin**: Reusable CRUD interfaces powered by Drizzle schemas

### Developer Happiness

- **Sensible Defaults**: Pre-configured with best practices
- **Clear Patterns**: Consistent structure across features
- **Migration Management**: Easy database schema evolution
- **Test Factories**: Reduce boilerplate with smart defaults

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for development)

### Initial Setup

**First time setup - copy environment configuration:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env.example` file includes all required defaults to get started immediately.

### Development with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Start all services in detached mode, run migrations, and follow logs
make up

# Stop all services
make down

# Clean all services and delete database files
make destroy
```

### Development without Docker

```bash
# Copy environment configuration (if not already done)
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

### Development Credentials

For quick testing during development:

- **Admin access**: Password "admin" with any suffix (e.g., "admin-123")
- **Regular user**: Password "password" with any suffix (e.g., "password-456")

**Note**: These are development-only credentials and should never be used in production.

```

**Important**: Directories with README.md files contain detailed documentation. Always read these when working in those areas.

## Testing

Tetrastack uses a comprehensive three-tier testing approach:

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Test individual functions and utilities
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Test component and action interactions
- **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`): Test complete user workflows with Playwright

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test types
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e         # E2E tests only

# Run CI pipeline (linting + all tests)
make ci
```

### Test Data Factories

Tetrastack uses the factory pattern (Fishery + Faker) to reduce test code by 87%:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Uses all defaults
await userFactory.create();

// ✅ Good - Uses traits for variation
await foodFactory.processed().fat().create();

// ⚠️ Use sparingly - Only when testing requires specific values
await userFactory.create({ email: 'specific@example.com' });
```

See [tests/factories/README.md](tests/factories/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Database Management

### Migrations

```bash
# Generate a new migration
npm run db:generate

# Apply migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Push schema changes (development only)
npm run db:push

# Open database studio (GUI)
npm run db:studio
```

### Migration Conflicts

When working with database migrations on different branches:

```bash
# Reset drizzle folder from main branch and regenerate migrations
make migration-reconcile
```

Use this to:

- Regenerate migrations after rebasing with conflicts
- Consolidate multiple migrations on a feature branch
- Clean up migration files before creating a pull request

See [src/lib/db/README.md](src/lib/db/README.md) for complete database documentation.

## Many-First Design Pattern

**Critical Architecture Principle**: All model CRUD operations work with arrays by default.

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - Use array operations
const [user] = await insertUsers([userData])
const [updated] = await updateUsers([eq(users.id, id)], updates)
await deleteUsers([eq(users.id, id)])

// ❌ Incorrect - Don't create single-record wrappers
async function createUser(data) { ... }  // NO!
async function updateUser(id, data) { ... }  // NO!
```

**Benefits**:

- Less code duplication
- Consistent API across all models
- Type-safe with full inference
- Easier to maintain

## Styling & Theming

Tetrastack includes a comprehensive theme system in `src/app/globals.css`:

- **Material Design-inspired**: Semantic color tokens (primary, surface, etc.)
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Built-in with `light-dark()` CSS functions
- **TailwindCSS Integration**: Utility classes following the theme system

**Always consult `src/app/globals.css` before writing custom styles.**

## MCP Servers

Tetrastack integrates with Model Context Protocol servers for enhanced AI development:

- **TypeScript Language Server**: Type-aware code intelligence and refactoring
- **Docker MCP**: Container management and debugging
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation for E2E testing

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for complete MCP server documentation.

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Workers

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run deploy
```

Tetrastack uses OpenNext for Cloudflare Workers deployment, providing:

- Edge computing for low latency
- Automatic scaling
- Global CDN distribution
- Integration with Turso edge database
- Cloudflare R2 for file storage and uploads

### Environment Variables

Tetrastack uses a three-tier configuration system:

- **Development**: `.env` file (local, git-ignored)
- **Production**: `wrangler.jsonc` (public vars) + Cloudflare Secrets (sensitive data)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions secrets and variables

**Quick Start**:

1. **Local Development**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure for local development
2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Public variables → Edit `wrangler.jsonc` (safe to commit)
   - Secrets → Set via `wrangler secret put SECRET_NAME` (never commit)
   - Templates in `.env.production.example`

**Key Variables**:

```env
# Required for production
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=   # In wrangler.jsonc (public)
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=     # Cloudflare secret
AUTH_SECRET=          # Cloudflare secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)

# Optional (when using these features)
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=       # In wrangler.jsonc (public)
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=   # Cloudflare secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=       # Cloudflare secret (for AI features)
```
