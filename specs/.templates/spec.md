## User Stories

<!--
  Start with user stories to maintain focus on user value.
  Each story should be independently testable and deliver standalone MVP value.
  Prioritize: P1 = critical/MVP, P2 = important, P3 = nice-to-have
-->

## Functional Requirements

<!--
  Specific capabilities the system MUST provide.
  Use unique IDs for traceability in tasks.md.
  Mark unclear items: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: reason]
-->

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement]

## Key Entities

<!--

- **[Entity2]**: [What it represents, relationships]

## Edge Cases

<!--
  Boundary conditions and error scenarios to handle.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?
- What if [unusual user behavior]?

## Success Criteria

<!--
